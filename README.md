# CUE-Helper

CUE-Helper is a tool to help you manage your [CUE](https://github.com/cue-lang/cue) files.

## Why?

As stated in https://github.com/cue-lang/cue/issues/2170 we can not manipulate lists in CUE using the golang API.

This tool is a workaround to this problem. It allows you to manipulate lists in CUE files. It also simplifies getting and setting values - also directly in CUE strings.
